            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We decided to make this website as a project for our web development class in college.
                The design scheme we decided to use is a bit 90s-eqsue, but we think it looks cool anyways.
                <!--as with the previous section, we should come up with something better to put here later-->
